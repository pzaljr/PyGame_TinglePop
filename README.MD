tagline:  He's floating around with that red balloon like a jackass!  Don't like that?  Do something about it!

If you're a zelda fan, you may have encountered tingle, a rather annoying elf with a red baloon who goes about doing his thing. Doesn't that annoy you?  It does annoy me.  For that reason, I've created this game, where you too can pop tingles baloon and cause him to fall to his death (unless elves bounce) on the grounds of Kakariko Village.  To play, hover your hookshot over him and revel in the beautiful *pop* while you watch him dissapear before your eyes.

To play run TinglePop.py and move your hookshot around!
